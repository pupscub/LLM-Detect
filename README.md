# LLM-Detection using DeBERTa-v3

A deep learning solution for detecting AI-generated text using fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 model. This project aims to distinguish between human-written and AI-generated text content[1].

## Problem Overview

The challenge addresses the critical need to identify AI-generated content in an era where Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly capable of producing human-like text. The ability to detect AI-generated content has important applications in:

- Academic integrity
- Content authenticity verification 
- Misinformation prevention
- Digital content moderation

## Solution Architecture

**Model**: DeBERTa-v3 (Deep Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

**Key Components**:
- Fine-tuned DeBERTa-v3 base model
- Binary classification head
- Custom preprocessing pipeline
- Model evaluation metrics

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/llm-detect
cd llm-detect
pip install -r requirements.txt
